I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [National Library of Medicine](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/research/) (NLM) in the USA, supervised by Dr. Augustin Luna. My research focuses on developing innovative methods for graph visualization and analysis, with a particular emphasis on their applications in bioinformatics. Currently, I am working on techniques that leverage large language models (LLMs) to enhance and broaden the use of graph-based biological notations. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at [MaCSBio](https://www.maastrichtuniversity.nl/research/maastricht-centre-systems-biology) in the Netherlands, and I earned a PhD in Computer Engineering from [Bilkent University](https://w3.cs.bilkent.edu.tr/) in Turkey.
